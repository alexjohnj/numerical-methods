# Numerical Methods

This repository contains my implementations of the various numerical algorithms
taught in a class I took at the University of Leeds. It contains both MATLAB and
Julia implementations of which the MATLAB ones were written during labs and the
Julia ones were written for fun.

Most of these functions aren't very useful, there are better more thoroughly
tested implementations available elsewhere. I'm just putting them up here to
show what I've done. If you do to decide to use them though, they're licensed
under the MIT license.
