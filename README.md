# SOEE2250 Numerical Methods

This repository contains my implementations of the various numerical
algorithms taught in [SOEE2250][class-link] (Numerical Methods &
Statistics) at the University of Leeds. It contains both MATLAB and
Julia implementations of which the MATLAB ones were written during
labs and the Julia ones were written for fun.

Most of these functions aren't very useful, there are better more
thoroughly tested implementations available elsewhere. I'm just
putting them up here to show what I've done. If you do to decide to
use them though, they're licensed under the MIT license.
